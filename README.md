# Truffle Seeder ([From Liberty Pie](https://libertypie.com))
Easily seed initial data to smart contracts using this npm package 

## Installation

### via npm

```sh
npm i --save @libertypie/truffle-seeder
```

### via yarn

```sh
yarn add  @libertypie/truffle-seeder
```


## Usage

#### Create new seed file 
```sh
yarn seeder-init --contract HelloContract --method SetHelloMethod
```

the --contract  is the contract you are targeting (eg. HelloContract)  
and --method is the  method or function in the targeted contract 

after the seed files has been created, check the seeds folder in your project root and edit the file in the files sub folder

below is a sample of how a seed file looks like 

```js
module.exports = {
    contract: 'HelloContract',
    method:   'SetHelloMethod',
    data: [
        /* 
         * to seed args multiple times, add extra arrays
         ['arg1','arg2',...'argn'],
         ['arg1', 'arg2'...'argn']
        */
    ]
}
```
You add the args using an array inside the data array  as shown 

#### Seed File Options

##### contract:
The name of the contract you are targeting, it should exist in truffle build folder

##### method: 
The method or function in the targetted contract where the data will be fed to 

##### processor: 
The processor is the function responsible for processing the data and calling the method/function from the contract
The default processor is located at [src/processors/StandardSeedProcessor.js](src/processors/StandardSeedProcessor.js)

below is a seed file with a custom processor

```js 
module.exports = {
    contract: 'HelloContract',
    method:   'SetHelloMethod',
    processor: customDataProcessor,
    data: [
        /* 
         * to seed args multiple times, add extra arrays
         ['arg1','arg2',...'argn'],
         ['arg1', 'arg2'...'argn']
        */
    ]
}

// customDataProcessor
customDataProcessor = async ({
    contractName,
    contractInstance, 
    contractMethod, 
    argsArray,
    networkId,
    web3,
    web3Account
}) => {
  //process and insert data here 
}
```

#### Seeding the data 
 To seed the data to the contract's method, you will run the command below

 ```sh 
  yarn seeder-run 
 ```
